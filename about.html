          <p>
            I am a highly motivated individual currently pursuing an MS in
            Computer Science, building on valuable experiences gained in my
            family business. With a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and
            Communication, I expanded my horizons by completing a diploma in
            Pharmacy while actively contributing to various aspects of our
            family enterprise. From sales to order management and team
            leadership, my journey reflects a strong commitment to growth and
            excellence. During my time in the family business, my fascination
            with our ERP software sparked my curiosity, driving me towards an MS
            in Computer Science. Though offered admission to both NYU Courant
            and USC Viterbi, I chose USC due to my passion for tennis and the
            welcoming climate it offers. As a proud member of USC's club tennis
            team, I've harnessed not only athletic prowess but also vital
            lessons in teamwork, discipline, and determination. My USC journey
            has exposed me to transformative courses, with one standout
            experience being the Web Technologies course under Professor Papa's
            guidance. Creating a functional Event Search website demonstrated my
            mastery of front-end and back-end development. Further, crafting an
            iOS app for event discovery solidified my skills and nurtured my
            confidence. Now, as I step into the next chapter, I am eager to
            gather practical industry experience through an internship. My goal
            is to contribute my expertise, foster continued growth as a software
            engineer, and drive impact in meaningful projects. Combining a
            strong business foundation, technical prowess, and the dedication of
            a student-athlete, I'm primed to thrive in the realm of software
            engineering, leaving a notable imprint wherever I go.
