          <h3>University of Southern California</h3>
          <p>Grader for CSCI-103 | <strong>Januray 2023 - May 2023</strong></p>

          <p>
            I had the privilege of serving as a grader for the 'Introduction to
            Programming in C++' course, where I played a pivotal role in shaping
            the learning experience of over 100 students. As a grader, I
            meticulously managed assignments and homework, ensuring timely
            feedback and constructive guidance for each student's progress. This
            opportunity not only honed my organizational skills but also allowed
            me to foster an environment of continuous improvement and growth
            among aspiring programmers.

          <h3>Shantilal & Company - India</h3>
          <p>
            Technology and Operations Manager |
            <strong>May 2017 - July 2022</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            In my role as a Technology and Operations Manager at Shantilal &
            Company, I spearheaded a team of 15 employees, orchestrating the
            seamless distribution of pharmaceutical products from 25 renowned
            companies, including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter &
            Gamble, to a diverse clientele encompassing retail outlets,
            hospitals, and medical colleges. Overseeing the entire
            pharmaceutical distribution ecosystem, I took charge of inventory
            management, customer service, and logistics, ensuring a well-oiled
            operational machinery. My commitment to innovation led to the
            implementation of streamlined processes that significantly reduced
            order processing time by an impressive 25%, driving heightened
            efficiency across the board. Furthermore, my collaborative mindset
            saw me collaborating closely with the sales and marketing teams,
            strategically crafting and executing data-driven initiatives that
            resulted in a remarkable 115% surge in sales figures. Merging my
            technical proficiency with my business acumen, I actively
            contributed to the company's growth and profitability, playing a
            pivotal role in its overall achievements. This experience has not
            only fortified my leadership and problem-solving skills but has also
            instilled in me a deep appreciation for the symbiosis of technology
            and business in driving success.
